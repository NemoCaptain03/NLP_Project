Graph
Each vertex is represented
by a dot or a circle
Each edge is represented by
a line connecting its
endpoints
Definition
A (undirected) graph G= (V,E)is defined by:
1Anon-empty set V of vertices ;
2A set E of edges , which are unordered pairs of vertices.
Note: In this course, we only consider finite graphs.

E={e1,e2,e3,e4,e5,e6,e7,e8,e9}
H.-T. Nguyen Graph 7 / 49
Multigraph and loop
Definition
A graph is simple if there is at most one edge between any pair of vertices.
Edges connecting the same pair of vertices are called multiple edges . A graph
having multiple edges is also called a multigraph .
Aloop is an edge connecting a vertex to itself.
Figure: Rosen, p. 650
Note: By convention, “graphs” refer to simple graphs without loops unless
otherwise stated.

Directed graph
Definition
Adirected graph (ordigraph ) G= (V,A)is defined by:
1Anon-empty set V of vertices (ornodes );
2A set A of arcs, which are ordered pairs of vertices.
The notions of simple directed graphs ,multiple arcs ,loops and directed
multigraphs are defined similarly to the undirected case.

Each node represents a team
Each team play against every other team, an arc goes from the winning team
to the losing team (assume that there are no ties)

Examples
Dependency (software):
Each node represents a module
An arc ( a,b) is added if module bdepends on module a

Adjacency, neighborhood
LetG= (V,E) be a graph.
Definition
Two vertices u and v are adjacent if they are endpoints of the same edge e.
In this case, u is a neighbor of v and the edge e is incident with the vertices
u and v.
The set of all neighbors of a vertex v is the neighborhood of v and is denoted
by N (v). The neighborhood of a set A of vertices is the union of the
neighborhoods of the vertices in A: N (A) =/uniontext
v∈AN(v).
H.-T. Nguyen Graph 21 / 49
Adjacency, neighborhood
Example:
v1is adjacent to v2;
v4is not adjacent to v2;
N(v2) ={v1,v3,v5,v6};
N({v1,v2}) ={v1,v2,v3,v5,v6};
N({v2,v3}) =V.
H.-T. Nguyen Graph 22 / 49
Degree
Definition
The degree of a vertex v, denoted by deg( v)or simply d (v), is the number of
edges incident with it. A loop contributes 2 to the degree of its endpoint.
deg( v1) = 1 ,deg( v2) = 4 .
H.-T. Nguyen Graph 23 / 49
Degree
Note:
A vertex is isolated if it has degree 0; it is pendant if it has degree 1.
In a multigraph, the degree of a vertex may be greater than the number of its
neighbors!

The handshaking theorem
Theorem
Let G = (V,E)be an undirected graph. Then
/summationdisplay
v∈Vdeg( v) = 2|E|.
Proof: Each edge contributes 2 to the sum of degrees of all the vertices.
Corollary
There are an even number of vertices of odd degrees.

initial node and v is the end node of a; a is an out-going arc of u and an in-going
arcof v.

Degrees
Definition
The out-degree (resp. in-degree ) of a node v, denoted by deg+(v)or d+(v)(resp.
deg−(v)or d−(v)), is the number of out-going (resp. in-going) arcs of v.

that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.

Subgraphs
Definition

subgraph induced by W is the subgraph of G where:

Some operations on graphs
LetG= (V,E) be a simple graph.
Edge removal:
G−e= (V,E\{e}).
Result: a subgraph of G.
Vertex removal:
G−v= (V\{v},E\{e|eis incidence with v}).
Result: a subgraph of G.
Edge contraction:
Remove an edge, then merge its endpoints.
Result: notnecessarily a subgraph!
