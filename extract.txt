LanguageProcessing(NLP)
•A natural language is a human spoken language, such as
English Arabic, French, … etc.
•One of the aims of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is to build
machines that can "understand" commands in natural
language, written or spoken.
•A computer that can do this requires very powerful
hardware and sophisticated software.
•At the present time, this is at the early stages of
development.

LanguageProcessing(NLP)
•It is not an easy task to teach a person or computer a
natural language.
•The main problems are syntax (the rules governing the way
in which words are arranged), and understanding context to
determine the meaning of a word.
•To interpret even simple phrases requires a vast amount of
knowledge.
•The basic goal of Natural language Processing is to enable
a person to communicate with a computer in a language
that they use in their everyday life.

Language
•Natural language are those that we use for communicating
with each other, eg. Arabic, English, French, Japanese, etc.
•Natural language are expressive and easy for us to use.
•Computer languages are those that we use for controlling
the operations of a computer, eg. Prolog, C, C++, C#, Java,
Python,…, etc.
•Computer languages are easy for a computer to
understand, but they are not expressive.

•Phonological Analysis
•Morphological Analysis
•Syntactic Analysis
•Semantic Analysis
•Pragmatic Analysis

(1)PhonologicalAnalysis
•Phonetics: deals with the physical building blocks of a
language sound system.
eg. sounds of ‘k’, ‘t’ and ‘e’ in ‘kite’
•Phonology: organization of speech sounds within a
language.
•eg. (1) different ‘k’ sounds in ‘kite’ vs ‘coat’
•(2) different ‘t’ and ‘p’ sounds in ‘top’ vs ‘pot’
2/22/2025NLP 11FiveProcessingStagesinaNLPSystem
(2)MorphologicalAnalysis
•Morphology is the structure of words.
•It is concerned with inflection . (i.eThe various forms of the
same basic word. eg. run-ran, dog-dogs, etc )
•It is also concerned with derivation of new words from
existing ones, eg. lighthouse (formed from light & house).
•In NLP, words are also known as lexicon items and a set of
words form a lexicon.
2/22/2025NLP 12FiveProcessingStagesinaNLPSystem
(2)MorphologicalAnalysis
•Any NL analysis system needs a lexicon {a module that tells what words there
are and what properties they have}.
•Simplest model is a full form dictionary that lists every word explicitly.
•Simply expanding the dictionary fails to take advantages of the regularities.
•No dictionary contains all the words one is likely to encounter in real input.
•Languages with highly productive morphology (e.g. Finnish, where a verb can
have many thousands of forms.)
•Noun combination.
2/22/2025NLP 13FiveProcessingStagesinaNLPSystem
(3)SyntacticAnalysis
•Syntactic analysis is concerned with the construction of sentences.
•Syntactic structure indicates how the words are related to each other.
•Syntax tree is assigned by a grammer and a lexicon.
•Lexicon indicates syntactic category of words.
•Grammar (typically Context Free Grammer) specifies legitimate
concatenations of constituents.
2/22/2025NLP 14FiveProcessingStagesinaNLPSystem
(4)SemanticAnalysis
•Semantic analysis is concerned with the meaning of the language.
•This stage uses the meanings of the word to extend and perhaps disambiguate
the result returned by the syntactic parse.
•The first step in any semantic processing system is to look up the individual
words in a dictionary (or lexicon) and extract their meanings.
•Unfortunately, many words have several meanings, for example, the word
‘diamond’ might have the following set of meanings:
(1) a geometrical shape with four equal sides.
(2) a baseball field
(3) an extremely hard and valuable gemstone
•To select the correct meaning for the word ‘diamond’ in the sentence Joan saw
Susan’s diamond shimmering from across the room.
2/22/2025NLP 15FiveProcessingStagesinaNLPSystem
(4)SemanticAnalysis
•It is necessary to know that neither geometrical shapes nor baseball fields
shimmer, whereas gemstones do (process of elimination).
•The process of determining the correct meaning of an individual word is call
word sense disambiguation or lexical disambiguation.
•It is done by associating, with each word in the lexicon, information about the
contexts in which each of the word’s senses may appear.
•Each of the words in a sentence can serve as part of the context in
which the meanings of the other words must be determined.

(5)PragmaticAnalysis
•This is an additional stage of analysis concerned with the pragmatic use of the
language.
•This is important in the understanding of texts and dialogues.
•There are many important relationships that may hold between phrases and
parts of their discourse context, as outlined below.
Identical entities. Consider :
•Bill had a red balloon.
•John wanted it.
•The word ‘it’ should be identified as referring to the red balloon. References
such as this are call anaphoric or anaphora.
