 The handshaking theorem is defined by the degree of a vertice in an undirected graph . Two vertices are adjacent if
 A graph G = (V,E)is abipartite graph if V can be partitioned into two sets V 1 and
 Every graph on nvertices is a subgraph of itself . The adjacency matrix of a graph is a V×V matrix
